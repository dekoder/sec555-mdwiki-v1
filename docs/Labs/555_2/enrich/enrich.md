For this lab you will be using the IDS alert logs below:

**EXE Download Alert**

```bash
[1:2000419:18] ET POLICY PE EXE or DLL Windows file download [Classification: Potential Corporate Privacy Violation] [Priority: 1]: <sodev-eth1-1> {TCP} 74.125.159.56:80 -> 192.168.2.39:49339
```

**PDF alert**

```bash
[1:2017899:3] ET CURRENT_EVENTS Possible PDF Dictionary Entry with Hex/Ascii replacement [Classification: A Network Trojan was detected] [Priority: 1]: <sodev-eth1-1> {TCP} 54.161.95.242:80 -> 192.168.2.39:49247
```

Your goal is to try and identify if any of these alerts are supsicious or malicious in nature.

## Exercises

### Identify available fields

Part of a SIEM is establishing context so that analysts can hypothesize and build a storyline of what may be happening. Often the process is thought to involve manual correlation. Yet, you can build context into your logs directly. Sometimes context can be at search time, and other times it needs to be part of the logs for use with automated alerting.

The first step in log enrichment is to identify what fields are available. The list of fields is necessary to see what options there are for enrichment. Open a command prompt and then run the below command to see what fields are available.

```bash
logstash -f /labs/enrich/field_list.conf
```

!!! note
    The configuration file **field_list.conf** uses **grok** to parse fields from a Snort IDS alert. You could also look at the alert and figure out what fields were available by looking at the data. However, in a production environment you would need to parse the log before enriching it.

The output should look as follows:

```bash
{
           "source_ip" => "54.161.95.242",
                 "gid" => 1,
                 "sid" => 2017899,
      "destination_ip" => "192.168.2.39",
         "source_port" => 80,
            "sequence" => 0,
                 "rev" => "3",
           "interface" => "sodev-eth1-1",
      "classification" => "A Network Trojan was detected",
            "protocol" => "TCP",
    "destination_port" => 49247,
            "priority" => "1",
                "host" => "logstash",
          "@timestamp" => 2020-07-06T22:23:09.686Z,
            "@version" => "1",
               "alert" => "ET CURRENT_EVENTS Possible PDF Dictionary Entry with Hex/Ascii replacement "
}
{
           "source_ip" => "74.125.159.56",
                 "gid" => 1,
                 "sid" => 2000419,
      "destination_ip" => "192.168.2.39",
         "source_port" => 80,
            "sequence" => 0,
                 "rev" => "18",
           "interface" => "sodev-eth1-1",
      "classification" => "Potential Corporate Privacy Violation",
            "protocol" => "TCP",
    "destination_port" => 49339,
            "priority" => "1",
                "host" => "logstash",
          "@timestamp" => 2020-07-06T22:23:09.686Z,
            "@version" => "1",
               "alert" => "ET POLICY PE EXE or DLL Windows file download "
}
```

!!! note
    The @timestamp will reflect the time you perform the command. It will not match the output in any of the commands during this lab.

Based on the output above the following fields are available: **source_ip**, **destination_ip**, **source_port**, **destination_port**, **protocol**, **sid**, **gid**, **rev**, **priority**, **alert**, **interface**, **classification**, and **sequence**.

Take a moment and look at the output above. Based on the two alerts, do you have enough information to tell if either alerts are malicious or not? Unfortunately, many alerting systems do not provide enough information to answer this question.

### Perform basic geo enrichment

Given the fields found, we need to identify areas to add context to the logs. IP addresses can be useful to use for geo information. Run Logstash with the configuration file below to add geoip information to the logs.

```bash
logstash -f /labs/enrich/geoip.conf
```

!!! note
	The **geoip.conf** configuration file uses Logstash with the **geoip** plugin to pull in **city**, **state**, **country**, and **ASN** information. If you are curious and wish to see the full configuration run this command: **code /labs/enrich/geoip.conf**

The output from this command should be similar to below:

```bash
{
      "classification" => "Potential Corporate Privacy Violation",
            "@version" => "1",
           "source_ip" => "74.125.159.56",
                "host" => "logstash",
                 "rev" => "18",
            "priority" => "1",
         "source_port" => 80,
                 "gid" => 1,
     "destination_geo" => {},
            "sequence" => 0,
            "protocol" => "TCP",
          "source_geo" => {
                    "ip" => "74.125.159.56",
              "latitude" => 37.419200000000004,
                "as_org" => "Google Inc.",
         "country_code3" => "US",
              "location" => {
            "lat" => 37.419200000000004,
            "lon" => -122.0574
        },
           "postal_code" => "94043",
        "continent_code" => "NA",
          "country_name" => "United States",
           "region_code" => "CA",
             "city_name" => "Mountain View",
              "dma_code" => 807,
                   "asn" => 15169,
              "timezone" => "America/Los_Angeles",
         "country_code2" => "US",
           "region_name" => "California",
             "longitude" => -122.0574
    },
          "@timestamp" => 2020-07-06T22:42:08.295Z,
           "interface" => "sodev-eth1-1",
      "destination_ip" => "192.168.2.39",
               "alert" => "ET POLICY PE EXE or DLL Windows file download ",
    "destination_port" => 49339,
                 "sid" => 2000419
}
{
      "classification" => "A Network Trojan was detected",
            "@version" => "1",
           "source_ip" => "54.161.95.242",
                "host" => "logstash",
                 "rev" => "3",
            "priority" => "1",
         "source_port" => 80,
                 "gid" => 1,
     "destination_geo" => {},
            "sequence" => 0,
            "protocol" => "TCP",
          "source_geo" => {
                    "ip" => "54.161.95.242",
              "latitude" => 39.0481,
                "as_org" => "Amazon.com, Inc.",
         "country_code3" => "US",
              "location" => {
            "lat" => 39.0481,
            "lon" => -77.4728
        },
           "postal_code" => "20149",
        "continent_code" => "NA",
          "country_name" => "United States",
           "region_code" => "VA",
             "city_name" => "Ashburn",
              "dma_code" => 511,
                   "asn" => 14618,
              "timezone" => "America/New_York",
         "country_code2" => "US",
           "region_name" => "Virginia",
             "longitude" => -77.4728
    },
          "@timestamp" => 2020-07-06T22:42:08.295Z,
           "interface" => "sodev-eth1-1",
      "destination_ip" => "192.168.2.39",
               "alert" => "ET CURRENT_EVENTS Possible PDF Dictionary Entry with Hex/Ascii replacement ",
    "destination_port" => 49247,
                 "sid" => 2017899
}
```

At this point, basic geoip information is now appended to the logs. The geoip information adds more context about these alerts. For example, the **ET POLICY PE EXE or DLL Windows file download** shows an external IP of **74.125.159.56**. The geoip information shows it is in **Mountain View, California US** and the entity behind the external IP is **Google Inc.**. The **ET CURRENT_EVENTS Possible PDF Dictionary Entry with Hex/Ascii replacement** shows an external IP of **54.161.95.242**. The geoip information shows it is in **Ashburn, VA US** and the entity behind the external IP is **Amazon.com, Inc.**.

At this point there still is not enough information to decide if either of these alerts are malicious or suspicious. The external IP addresses could belong to Google or Amazon. However, they also could belong to someone using Google or Amazon's hosted cloud environments.

### Pull in DNS Query

Next, run Logstash using the dns.conf configuration file to further enrich the IDS alerts. Run the command below to add a query field to the IDS alerts.

```bash
logstash -f /labs/enrich/dns.conf
```

!!! note
	The **dns.conf** configuration file uses Logstash with the **elasticsearch** plugin to pull in the DNS **query** from historical DNS logs. It does this by looking for the most recent DNS query reponse that had an external IP from the IDS alert in an **answers** field. If you are curious and wish to see the full configuration run this command: **code /labs/enrich/dns.conf**

The output should now look like below.

```bash
{
    "destination_port" => 49339,
            "sequence" => 0,
           "source_ip" => "74.125.159.56",
           "interface" => "sodev-eth1-1",
               "alert" => "ET POLICY PE EXE or DLL Windows file download ",
          "source_geo" => {
              "dma_code" => 807,
                "as_org" => "Google Inc.",
              "location" => {
            "lon" => -122.0574,
            "lat" => 37.419200000000004
        },
             "longitude" => -122.0574,
                    "ip" => "74.125.159.56",
           "postal_code" => "94043",
         "country_code3" => "US",
           "region_code" => "CA",
                   "asn" => 15169,
             "city_name" => "Mountain View",
        "continent_code" => "NA",
         "country_code2" => "US",
              "timezone" => "America/Los_Angeles",
              "latitude" => 37.419200000000004,
          "country_name" => "United States",
           "region_name" => "California"
    },
            "priority" => "1",
                "host" => "logstash",
            "protocol" => "TCP",
            "@version" => "1",
                 "gid" => 1,
                "tags" => [
        [0] "internal_destination",
        [1] "external_source"
    ],
                 "sid" => 2000419,
         "source_port" => 80,
      "destination_ip" => "192.168.2.39",
      "classification" => "Potential Corporate Privacy Violation",
                 "rev" => "18",
     "destination_geo" => {},
               "query" => "dl.google.com",
          "@timestamp" => 2020-07-09T22:44:21.312Z
}
{
    "destination_port" => 49247,
            "sequence" => 0,
           "source_ip" => "54.161.95.242",
           "interface" => "sodev-eth1-1",
               "alert" => "ET CURRENT_EVENTS Possible PDF Dictionary Entry with Hex/Ascii replacement ",
          "source_geo" => {
              "dma_code" => 511,
                "as_org" => "Amazon.com, Inc.",
              "location" => {
            "lon" => -77.4728,
            "lat" => 39.0481
        },
             "longitude" => -77.4728,
                    "ip" => "54.161.95.242",
           "postal_code" => "20149",
         "country_code3" => "US",
           "region_code" => "VA",
                   "asn" => 14618,
             "city_name" => "Ashburn",
        "continent_code" => "NA",
         "country_code2" => "US",
              "timezone" => "America/New_York",
              "latitude" => 39.0481,
          "country_name" => "United States",
           "region_name" => "Virginia"
    },
            "priority" => "1",
                "host" => "logstash",
            "protocol" => "TCP",
            "@version" => "1",
                 "gid" => 1,
                "tags" => [
        [0] "internal_destination",
        [1] "external_source"
    ],
                 "sid" => 2017899,
         "source_port" => 80,
      "destination_ip" => "192.168.2.39",
      "classification" => "A Network Trojan was detected",
                 "rev" => "3",
     "destination_geo" => {},
               "query" => "trackmypackage-com.biz",
          "@timestamp" => 2020-07-09T22:44:21.311Z
}
```

At this point, the IDS alerts have more significant context. For example, one alert deals with traffic to **dl.google.com** which is hosted on an external IP registered to an ASN of **Google Inc.**. **dl.google.com** is Google's download site for anyone wishing to download software like Google Chrome, Google Drive Sync, as well as other Google software. As a result, the alert dealing with Google is likely benign.

The other alert reflects traffic going to **trackmypackage-com.biz** which is hosted on an external IP registered to an ASN of **Amazon.com Inc**. **trackymypackage-com.biz** looks like a suspicious domain due to having **-com.biz** rather than simply **.com** or **.biz**. The ASN allows a possible hypothesis that this is a server hosted within Amazon's AWS environment.

### Pull in Endpoint Data

Bringing in the DNS records greatly aids analysts during their investigations. However, there still is more enrichment that can be performed to minimize labor requirements during alert investigations. For the final step of this labs run the command below to correlate the IDS alerts so they automatically correlate and bring in endpoint-centric information.

```bash
logstash -f /labs/enrich/windows.conf
```

!!! note
	The **windows.conf** configuration file adds additional enrichment steps. First, it takes the **source_ip**, **source_port**, **destination_ip**, and **destination_port** fields and uses them to find endpoint logs referencing the same network socket. If found, it pulls back the **process** behind the network connection, the end **user* running the process, and the **process id**. Finally, it uses the **process id** to see if there is an endpoint log showing a **file** written by the **process id**.  If you are curious and wish to see the full configuration run this command: **code /labs/enrich/windows.conf**

```bash
{

                 "rev" => "18",

In addition to the DNS **query** behind the network socket you now also have the **process**, **user**, and a **file name** written by the process. At this point, you can form a much better conclusion of what is occurring.

The **dl.google.com** alert probably is the user **JustinHenderson** using **iexplore.exe** to download **ChromeSetup.exe**. The user is likely trying to switch browsers from Internet Explorer to Google Chrome. Therefore, the first alert is probably a false positive and benign.

The **trackmypackage-com.biz** alert probably is the user **JustinHenderson** downloading a PDF using **msedge.exe**. The PDF is specifically called **shipment_notification_555.pdf**. This alert cannot yet be confirmed as malicious, but the additional context leans towards it being a potential phishing PDF.
